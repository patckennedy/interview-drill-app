# Interview Drill App

A simple, mobile-friendly web app to **store, practice, and drill interview questions** with **my own natural answers** — anytime, anywhere.  

This is a personal learning project built in public as part of my **software developer interview prep**.  
Feel free to explore or fork the code for your own practice.
